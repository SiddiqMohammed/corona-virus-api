# coronavirus-API
A custom web scraper finds the current live coronavirus data and then uploads it to a database. A website was made using this data which can be found [here](https://coroana-counter.firebaseapp.com/) and here is its [GitHub](https://github.com/SiddiqMohammed/Live_corona_data) page.

I used firebase for my database so the following instructions are for it. 

### Setup
1. Open the Auth.JSON file and add the specified fields


2. Specify the location of the JSON file on line 8

That's It!
Run The Code And The Database Will Be Updated!
